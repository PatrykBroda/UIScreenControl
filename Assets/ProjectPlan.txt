# Unity Android App + Web Control System Plan

## Project Overview
Build a Unity Android app that displays different screens/content controlled remotely by a website, with multi-user login system.

## Tech Stack Suggestions
- **Unity**: Android app development
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io (or ASP.NET Core + SignalR)
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets (Socket.io or SignalR)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Hosting**: Heroku/Railway/Vercel + MongoDB Atlas

## Phase 1: Core Setup (Week 1-2)
### Backend Foundation
- [ ] Set up basic Express server with CORS
- [ ] Create user registration/login endpoints
- [ ] Set up JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Basic database schema for users
- [ ] Test authentication with Postman

### Unity Basic Setup
- [ ] Create new Unity project with Android build settings
- [ ] Set up basic UI system (Canvas, panels for different screens)
- [ ] Create a simple connection manager script
- [ ] Test building to Android device

## Phase 2: Real-time Communication (Week 2-3)
### Backend WebSocket Setup
- [ ] Add Socket.io to server
- [ ] Create room system (users can join specific app instances)
- [ ] Handle screen change events
- [ ] Add user session management

### Unity WebSocket Integration
- [ ] Add WebSocket library to Unity (NativeWebSocket or similar)
- [ ] Create connection manager that connects to server
- [ ] Handle incoming screen change messages
- [ ] Create basic screen switching system

### Test Integration
- [ ] Simple test: website sends "show screen 2" → app switches to screen 2

## Phase 3: User Management & Web Interface (Week 3-4)
### Web Frontend
- [ ] Create login/register pages
- [ ] Build dashboard showing connected apps
- [ ] Create control panel with screen options
- [ ] Add real-time status indicators

### Enhanced Backend
- [ ] Add app registration system (each app gets unique ID)
- [ ] Implement user permissions (who can control which apps)
- [ ] Add logging/history of screen changes
- [ ] Error handling and reconnection logic

## Phase 4: Content Management (Week 4-5)
### Unity Screen System
- [ ] Create modular screen system (easy to add new screens)
- [ ] Add different screen types (image, video, text, interactive)
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between screens
- [ ] Add offline mode (fallback content when disconnected)

### Web Content Management
- [ ] Upload system for images/videos
- [ ] Screen template system
- [ ] Preview functionality
- [ ] Bulk actions (control multiple apps at once)

## Phase 5: Polish & Deploy (Week 5-6)
### Stability & Performance
- [ ] Add reconnection logic for network issues
- [ ] Optimize Unity build size
- [ ] Add error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple users

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy backend to cloud service
- [ ] Deploy frontend
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Create APK distribution method

### Documentation
- [ ] User guide for web interface
- [ ] Setup instructions for Android app
- [ ] API documentation

## Quick Start Development Order
1. **Day 1-2**: Basic Express server + Unity project setup
2. **Day 3-4**: Get WebSocket communication working (simple ping/pong)
3. **Day 5-7**: Basic screen switching functionality
4. **Week 2**: Add authentication and web interface
5. **Week 3+**: Expand features and polish

## Key Technical Considerations

### Security
- Use HTTPS/WSS in production
- Validate all incoming messages
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Sanitize user inputs

### Scalability
- Consider using Redis for session storage
- Design database schema for growth
- Plan for horizontal scaling if needed

### Unity-Specific Notes
- Test on multiple Android versions/devices
- Handle different screen sizes/orientations
- Plan for app backgrounding/foregrounding
- Consider using Unity's new Input System

### WebSocket Architecture
```
Website → Server → Unity App
       ↙        ↘
   User Auth    Screen Data
   Room Mgmt    Status Updates
```

## Flexible Development Tips
- Start with hardcoded screens, make them dynamic later
- Use simple UI initially, polish later
- Test early and often on real devices
- Keep commits small and frequent
- Don't optimize prematurely - get it working first!

## Emergency Backup Plan
If WebSockets get complex, start with simple HTTP polling:
- Unity checks server every 2-3 seconds for updates
- Less real-time but much simpler to implement
- Can always upgrade to WebSockets later
